# Advanced-RAG-App-Using-AWS-Bedrock-Streamlit-And-Langchain


Create an interactive application that allows users to ask questions about the content of PDF documents. The application uses AWS Bedrock and LangChain to process PDF documents, generate embeddings, store and retrieve them using FAISS, and generate responses using large language models (LLMs). The user interface is built with Streamlit, providing a web-based platform for interacting with the application.

This project demonstrates the integration of advanced language models and document processing technologies to build an interactive question-answering system based on PDF content. By leveraging AWS Bedrock, LangChain, and Streamlit, the project provides a robust solution for extracting insights and answering questions from document text.

What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
RAG combines two key components:

Retrieval: This part involves searching for relevant information from a large database or collection of documents. When a query is given, the system uses a retrieval mechanism to find documents or snippets that are most relevant to the query. This step is similar to how a search engine works, pulling up the most relevant web pages for your search terms.

Generation: After retrieving the relevant documents, a language model generates a response. This is done by using the retrieved information as context to produce a more accurate and informed response. The language model synthesizes information from the documents and creates a coherent answer to the query.
